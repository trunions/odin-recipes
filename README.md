# odin-recipes

This is the first project of The Odin Project. 
I will be making a simple page where you can view recipes. 
I will be using basic HTML tags such as <h1> - <h6>, <p>,<a>,<ul>,<ol>,<li> and <img> to make headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and add pictures. 
This will be a multi page website with 3 different recipes.
This project will be revisited to add CSS at a later date.
